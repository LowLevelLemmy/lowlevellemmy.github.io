    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Lemmy LLC</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: 9/14/2025</strong></p>
    <p>Lemmy LLC (“we,” “our,” or “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile applications (“Apps”) collect, use, and share information.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect personally identifiable information directly. Our Apps may collect certain technical data automatically, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device type and operating system</li>
      <li>App usage data (e.g., screens viewed, session length)</li>
      <li>Anonymous advertising identifiers (e.g., Apple’s IDFA)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you make an in-app purchase, Apple processes the payment. We do not receive or store payment information.</p>

    <h2>2. Use of Information</h2>
    <p>We use collected data to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and improve the App</li>
      <li>Show advertisements (unless you purchase “Remove Ads”)</li>
      <li>Process in-app purchases and restore past purchases</li>
      <li>Ensure compliance with Apple App Store requirements</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We may use third-party services such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Google AdMob (for ads)</li>
      <li>Unity IAP / Apple App Store (for purchases)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These providers may collect and use data according to their own privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Apps are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If we discover that such data has been provided, we will delete it promptly.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain only minimal data as necessary for the App to function. Advertising identifiers can be reset at any time in your device settings.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Choices</h2>
    <p>You can disable personalized ads by adjusting device privacy settings (e.g., “Limit Ad Tracking” or “Allow Apps to Request to Track”).</p>
    <p>You may remove ads permanently by purchasing the “Remove Ads” option.</p>
    <p>You may delete the App at any time to stop data collection.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted within the App or at the policy link provided in the App Store listing.</p>
